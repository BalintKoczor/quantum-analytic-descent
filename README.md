# Quantum Analytic Descent
This repository contians the C implementation of Quantum Analyitic Descent which is a technique for the optimisation of variational
quantum circuits. Our code implements the classical algorithm for computing the gradient vector as described in the preprint:

BÃ¡lint Koczor, Simon C Benjamin (2020) ArXiv preprint, [arXiv:2008.13774](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13774.pdf)

The C code contains a binding to Mathematica and a demonstration notebook has been included
that shows how this code can be used in tandem with [QuESTlink](https://github.com/QTechTheory/QuESTLink).
